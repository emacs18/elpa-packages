This file should not be confused with Rick Bielawski's cobol-mode.el
(http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/cobol-mode.el), which this mode attempts to
supersede.

This COBOL mode features syntax highlighting for most modern COBOL dialects,
indentation, code skeletons, rulers and basic formatting functions.
Highlighting changes with the code format, which can be specified using the
M-x customize menu.
