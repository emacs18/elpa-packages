  "timerfunctions.el contains some “enhanced” versions of a few timer.el
functions.  It is also used by vel.el, idledo.el etc.

 Suppose you want Emacs to run an action every REDOSECS for
 _as_long_as Emacs remains idle.  `tf-run-with-idle-timer' allows that.

 `tf-with-timeout' is a generalized with-timeout where you can inhibit
 breaks within parts of the body that you want.

 QUICKSTART:
 Place this file somewhere in your load-path, and add the
 following to your ~/.emacs: (load \"timerfunctions.el\")

  "Similar to `run-with-idle-timer', except that provides more options.

Args are SECS, REPEAT, REDOSECS, REDOREPEAT, INCLUDERUNTIME,
FUNCTION and &rest ARGS.

Similar to `run-with-idle-timer', but provides more options.
Suppose you want Emacs to run an action every REDOSECS for as
long as Emacs remains idle.  Emacs' `run-with-idle-timer' will
perform the action exactly once every time Emacs goes idle.  This
function, on the other hand, will allow
you to keep performing an action as long as Emacs remains idle.

SECS is the number of seconds to wait once Emacs has first gone
idle or a function that returns this number when called with no arguments.
Note that the way `run-with-idle-timer' is defined, SECS will
unfortunately be called immediately after you call this function, but
REDOSECS will be *every* time Emacs *remains* idle..yay..

If REDOREPEAT is non-nil, the action is repeated as long Emacs remains
idle.  REDOSECS is the number of additional seconds (after the action
has been done) to wait if Emacs remains idle before performing the
action again.  Again, redosecs does not have to be a number, it can be
a function which yields such a number...

If INCLUDERUNTIME is non-nil, REDOSECS is the number of
additional seconds to wait after the action has been invoked (not
finished).

If REPEAT is nonnil, the entire cycle is repeated every time Emacs
next goes idle.. (as in the default `run-with-idle-timer')."

(defmacro tf-with-timeout (inhibit-var timertag timedoutvar tlist &rest body)
  "Like `with-timeout' but with support for unbreakable code.

Provides ability to inhibit timeout during parts of the body.
Note that most of the time, you may not need this functionality
at all unless you want to be very “clean” about things---you
could get by with the regular with-timeout and not using
sit-for's in the body.  Or with the regular with-timeout and
using unwind-protect.


A judicious use of `unwind-protect' may seem to alleviate the
need for this function. This function, however, provides
additional flexibility in that the inhibitedness can be altered
at run-time depending on various conditions.


Run BODY, but if it doesn't finish in SECONDS seconds, give up.
If we give up, we run the TIMEOUT-FORMS which are contained in TLIST
and return the value of the last one.
The call should look like:
 (tf-with-timeout quoted-expr (SECONDS TIMEOUT-FORMS...) BODY...)

The timeout is checked whenever Emacs waits for some kind of external
event \(such as keyboard input, input from subprocesses, or a certain time);
if the program loops without waiting in any way, the timeout will not
be detected.  Furthermore:

During the execution of the body, we SHALL NOT time out when INHIBIT-VAR's
content is non-nil.  Thus, for example, you might initially setq a
variable my-var as nil, supply inhibitp as `my-var', and then you may
setq my-var to t or nil within the body of tf-with-timeout to enable
or disable timeout.  The best use of this functionality is to setq
inhibitp to t when during parts of loops where you do not want the
body broken within certain parts of the loop.  (Of course, if that
part of the loop does not contain any sit-for's or read's then you
don't have to worry about this in the first place..)


Again, Do not forget to bind my-var to some value before attempting to use this
tf-with-timeout :)

Here's an example:


 (let ((myinhibit t))
  (tf-with-timeout \\='myinhibit \\='mytag \\='mytimedoutvar
		   (2 2)
		   (setq a nil)
		   (setq b nil)
		   (sit-for 4)
		   (setq a 4)
		   (setq myinhibit nil)
		   (sit-for 2)
		   (setq b 5)
		   ))


The above example requests a timeout within 2 seconds.  However, the
timeout can takes place only when myinhibit is set to nil,
which becomes true after about 4 seconds.  Thus, after the execution of the
body, a has the value 4, but b has the value nil.

See `tf-test-timeout' for another example.

Important Note: If the body of a loop tends to stay in a timeout
inhibited region for most of the time, then make sure that the timeout
enabled region atleast spans about 0.02 seconds.. thus, use (sleep-for
0.02) if needed.. this is because we check every 0.01 seconds if an
uninhibited timeout condition has been satisfied.

But perhaps you do not want to include (sleep-for 0.02) because that
wastes precious cpu time.  Simple, don't include it, just after a long
inhibited body, you can include a timeout check within the body
instead of (sleep-for 0.02):
 (tf-with-timeout-check \\='mytag \\='mytimedoutvar \\='myinhibitp)

Moreover, if that is the main check you rely on, you it perhaps makes
sense to increase the value of `tf-with-timeout-repeat-sec', so that
your cpu cycles are not wasted every 0.01 sec.  See the doc of that
variable for more.

TIMERTAG should be a quoted symbol, also we WILL set that symbol to t
during the execution of these forms.
