Company is a modular completion framework.  Modules for retrieving completion
candidates are called backends, modules for displaying them are frontends.

Company comes with many backends, e.g. `company-etags'.  These are
distributed in separate files and can be used individually.

Enable `company-mode' in all buffers with M-x global-company-mode.  For
further information look at the documentation for `company-mode' (C-h f
company-mode RET).

If you want to start a specific backend, call it interactively or use
`company-begin-backend'.  For example:
M-x company-abbrev will prompt for and insert an abbrev.

To write your own backend, look at the documentation for `company-backends'.
Here is a simple example completing "foo":

(defun company-my-backend (command &amp;optional arg &amp;rest ignored)
  (interactive (list 'interactive))
  (pcase command
    (`interactive (company-begin-backend 'company-my-backend))
    (`prefix (company-grab-symbol))
    (`candidates (list "foobar" "foobaz" "foobarbaz"))
    (`meta (format "This value is named %s" arg))))

Sometimes it is a good idea to mix several backends together, for example to
enrich gtags with dabbrev-code results (to emulate local variables).  To do
this, add a list with both backends as an element in `company-backends'.

# History of user-visible changes

## 2020-07-26 (0.9.13)

* `company-clang`: error handling is more permissive.
* `company-tng` stops disabling `post-completion` in backends
  ([#946](https://github.com/company-mode/company-mode/pull/946)). Instead,
  `company-tng-configure-default` disables snippet expansion in most popular
  backends. If a backend you use needs this and is not covered, and you use
  `company-tng`, disable snippet insertion by customizing a relevant option
  provided by the backend. The result is better compatibility with LSP backends
  because they currently depend on `post-completion` in all cases.
* `company-keywords`: additions for C and C++.
* `company-yasnippet` supports the `doc-buffer` action.
* `company-bbdb` supports more headers.

## 2020-02-07 (0.9.12)

* Tooltip rendering bugfix.
* `company-indent-or-complete-common` is better compatible with
  `indent-for-tab-command`
  ([comment](https://github.com/company-mode/company-mode/issues/94#issuecomment-571265393)).

## 2020-01-03 (0.9.11)

* New value for option `company-show-numbers` to show numbers on the left.
* `company-gtags` has some minor fixes.
* Face definitions have moved to a separate group: `company-faces`.
* `company-capf`'s `:exit-function` handling has been improved
  ([#935](https://github.com/company-mode/company-mode/issues/935)).
* New user option `company-clang-use-compile-flags-txt`
  ([#933](https://github.com/company-mode/company-mode/issues/933)).
* Support for completion style specific sorting (Emacs 27 feature).
* Snippet/template field interaction is inhibited while completion is active
  (where by default `TAB` calls `company-complete-common`, clashing with snippet
  map binding `TAB` to "jump to the next field"). Affects both
  `company-template` and `yasnippet` (requires version 0.14.0).

## 2019-04-15 (0.9.10)

* `company-clang`: better compatibility with Clang 8
  ([#885](https://github.com/company-mode/company-mode/issues/885)).
* The change in `company-clang` regarding identity #defines is reverted because
  it affected other completions as well
  ([#884](https://github.com/company-mode/company-mode/issues/884)).
* `company-idle-delay` now accepts a function which generates the idle time or
  nil indicating no idle completion.
* Add custom variable `company-show-numbers-function` to make numbers of
  candidates customizable. 
* When a symbol is already typed in full, calling `M-x company-complete` will
  now run its post-completion action (e.g. inserting method parameters
  template). Calling `M-x company-manual-begin` or invoking a backend command
  directly will show the popup
  ([#150](https://github.com/company-mode/company-mode/issues/150),
  [#476](https://github.com/company-mode/company-mode/issues/476)).

## 2018-12-13 (0.9.9)

* Fix for the changes in the previous release.
* New hook `company-after-completion-hook`.
* `company-clang` removes identity preprocessor #defines from completions
  ([#841](https://github.com/company-mode/company-mode/issues/841)).

## 2018-12-08 (0.9.8)

* CAPF backend fixed to use the right `:exit-function`. It can now safely be a
  closure with lexical context capturing the buffer state at the moment when the
  completion table was returned
  ([#845](https://github.com/company-mode/company-mode/pull/845)).

## 2018-11-06 (0.9.7)

* For more sophisticated highlighting in non-prefix completion, a backend may
  now respond to a `match` request with a list of regions.  See
  `company-backends`.
  ([#798](https://github.com/company-mode/company-mode/issues/798),
  [#762](https://github.com/company-mode/company-mode/issues/762))
* The `company-capf` backend will pick up on a `:company-match` metadata element
  on the capf function (similar to `:company-location` or `:company-doc-buffer`)
  and use it as a response to aforementioned `match` request.
* `company-cmake` supports completion inside string interpolations
  ([#714](https://github.com/company-mode/company-mode/pull/714)).
