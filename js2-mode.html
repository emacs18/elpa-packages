This JavaScript editing mode supports:

 - strict recognition of the Ecma-262 language standard
 - support for most Rhino and SpiderMonkey extensions from 1.5 and up
 - parsing support for ECMAScript for XML (E4X, ECMA-357)
 - accurate syntax highlighting using a recursive-descent parser
 - on-the-fly reporting of syntax errors and strict-mode warnings
 - undeclared-variable warnings using a configurable externs framework
 - "bouncing" line indentation to choose among alternate indentation points
 - smart line-wrapping within comments and strings
 - code folding:
   - show some or all function bodies as {...}
   - show some or all block comments as /*...*/
 - context-sensitive menu bar and popup menus
 - code browsing using the `imenu' package
 - many customization options

Installation:

To install it as your major mode for JavaScript editing:

  (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.js\\'" . js2-mode))

Alternatively, to install it as a minor mode just for JavaScript linting,
you must add it to the appropriate major-mode hook.  Normally this would be:

  (add-hook 'js-mode-hook 'js2-minor-mode)

You may also want to hook it in for shell scripts running via node.js:

  (add-to-list 'interpreter-mode-alist '("node" . js2-mode))

Use Emacs 27 and want to write JSX?  Then use `js2-minor-mode' as described
above.  Use Emacs 26 or earlier?  Then use `js2-jsx-mode':

  (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.jsx?\\'" . js2-jsx-mode))
  (add-to-list 'interpreter-mode-alist '("node" . js2-jsx-mode))

Note that linting of JSX code may fail in both modes.

To customize how it works:
  M-x customize-group RET js2-mode RET

Notes:

This mode includes a port of Mozilla Rhino's scanner, parser and
symbol table.  Ideally it should stay in sync with Rhino, keeping
`js2-mode' current as the EcmaScript language standard evolves.

Unlike cc-engine based language modes, js2-mode's line-indentation is not
customizable.  It is a surprising amount of work to support customizable
indentation.  The current compromise is that the tab key lets you cycle among
various likely indentation points, similar to the behavior of python-mode.

This mode does not yet work with "multi-mode" modes such as `mmm-mode'
and `mumamo', although it could be made to do so with some effort.
This means that `js2-mode' is currently only useful for editing JavaScript
files, and not for editing JavaScript within &lt;script> tags or templates.

<h2>News</h2><pre>
# History of user-visible changes

## 2020-12-20

* Support for logical assignment operators ([#564](https://github.com/mooz/js2-mode/issues/564)).
* Support for the nullish coalescing operator ([#561](https://github.com/mooz/js2-mode/pull/561)).
* Emacs 27 now provides improved JSX indentation support, along with
  new JSX highlighting and detection support. Install Emacs 27 and use
  `js-mode` with `js2-minor-mode` (see README), rather than
  `js2-jsx-mode`.
* Using `js2-jsx-mode` will now trigger a warning in Emacs 27.
* Support for optional-chaining operator `?.`

## 2019-02-19

* Changed the default of `js2-strict-trailing-comma-warning` to nil.

## 2018-03-01

* Support single-line JSDocs.
* New face `js2-object-property-access`.
* Support for trailing comma in function arguments
* JSDoc highlighting for `@yield`, `@yields`, `@abstract`, `@virtual` and `@typedef`.
* Support for anonymous class exports.

## 2017-07-21

* Support for async arrow function without parentheses.
* Support for `/*jslint` declarations.
* User option `js2-getprop-has-side-effects`.
* Support for trailing commas in function parameter lists.
* Support for ES7 public class fields.
* New user option `js2-ignored-warnings`.

## 2017-01-16

* `js2-include-*-externs` are now evaluated on demand.  As a result,
  they can now be effectively used as file- or directory-local
  variables.
* Support for ES7 exponentiation operator.

## 2016-06-23

* New variable `js2-mode-assume-strict`, for use with ES6 modules.
* Support for JSDoc @callback, @func and @method tags.
* Object properties are highlighted using a different face:
  `js2-object-property`, which has no color by default.
* Experimental support for object rest/spread ECMAScript proposal.
* `js2-getter-setter-node` is renamed to `js2-method-node`, together with
  its related functions.  It already handles generator methods, and we
  added support for async methods (see below), so the old name would get
  more confusing.
* Support for default parameters in destructuring.  It should work for both
  objects and arrays, in both literals and function arguments.
* New mode: `js2-jsx-mode`, deriving from `js2-mode`.  Supports indentation of
  JSXElement expressions wrapped within parentheses or as function arguments.
  Indentation is customizable via `sgml-attribute-offset`.
* Experimental support for async/await ECMAScript proposal.

## 20150909

* `js2-mode` now derives from `js-mode`. That means the former
  function will run `js-mode-hook`, as well as `js2-mode-hook`. The
  key bindings will default to `js-mode-map` where they're not set in
  `js2-mode-map`. And in Emacs 25 or later (including the snapshot
  builds), `js2-mode` uses the indentation code from `js-mode`.  Where
  feasible, the user options (and functions) now have aliases, but if
  you're using Emacs 25 and you see an indentation-related setting
  that stopped working, try looking for a corresponding one in the
  `js` group: `M-x customize-group RET js RET`.

* New command: `js2-jump-to-definition`. It's bound to `M-.` by
  default, via remapping `js-find-symbol`. To get back to the default
  `M-.` binding (e.g. `find-tag`), put this in your init file:

      (eval-after-load 'js (define-key js-mode-map (kbd "M-.") nil))

## 20150713

* More comprehensive strict mode warnings and syntax errors.
* New minor mode: `js2-highlight-unused-variables-mode`.
* `js2-pretty-multiline-declarations` can take the value `dynamic` now.

## 20150202

Support for:

* [ES6 modules](http://www.2ality.com/2014/09/es6-modules-final.html).
* [Short-hand object literals](http://ariya.ofilabs.com/2013/02/es6-and-object-literal-property-value-shorthand.html).
* [Method definitions](http://ariya.ofilabs.com/2013/03/es6-and-method-definitions.html).
* ['u' and 'y' RegExp flags](https://mathiasbynens.be/notes/es6-unicode-regex).
* [Computed property names](http://people.mozilla.org/~jorendorff/es6-draft.html#sec-object-initializer).
* [Class statements and expression...
