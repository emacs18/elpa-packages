  Basic steps to setup:

   (add-to-list 'load-path
                "~/path-to-yasnippet")
   (require 'yasnippet)
   (yas-global-mode 1)


  Interesting variables are:

      `yas-snippet-dirs'

          The directory where user-created snippets are to be
          stored.  Can also be a list of directories.  In that case,
          when used for bulk (re)loading of snippets (at startup or
          via `yas-reload-all'), directories appearing earlier in
          the list override other dir's snippets.  Also, the first
          directory is taken as the default for storing the user's
          new snippets.

          The deprecated `yas/root-directory' aliases this variable
          for backward-compatibility.


  Major commands are:

      M-x yas-expand

          Try to expand snippets before point.  In `yas-minor-mode',
          this is normally bound to TAB, but you can customize it in
          `yas-minor-mode-map'.

      M-x yas-load-directory

          Prompts you for a directory hierarchy of snippets to load.

      M-x yas-activate-extra-mode

          Prompts you for an extra mode to add snippets for in the
          current buffer.

      M-x yas-insert-snippet

          Prompts you for possible snippet expansion if that is
          possible according to buffer-local and snippet-local
          expansion conditions.  With prefix argument, ignore these
          conditions.

      M-x yas-visit-snippet-file

          Prompts you for possible snippet expansions like
          `yas-insert-snippet', but instead of expanding it, takes
          you directly to the snippet definition's file, if it
          exists.

      M-x yas-new-snippet

          Lets you create a new snippet file in the correct
          subdirectory of `yas-snippet-dirs', according to the
          active major mode.

      M-x yas-load-snippet-buffer

          When editing a snippet, this loads the snippet.  This is
          bound to "C-c C-c" while in the `snippet-mode' editing
          mode.

      M-x yas-tryout-snippet

          When editing a snippet, this opens a new empty buffer,
          sets it to the appropriate major mode and inserts the
          snippet there, so you can see what it looks like.  This is
          bound to "C-c C-t" while in `snippet-mode'.

      M-x yas-describe-tables

          Lists known snippets in a separate buffer.  User is
          prompted as to whether only the currently active tables
          are to be displayed, or all the tables for all major
          modes.

  If you have `dropdown-list' installed, you can optionally use it
  as the preferred "prompting method", putting in your .emacs file,
  for example:

      (require 'dropdown-list)
      (setq yas-prompt-functions '(yas-dropdown-prompt
                                   yas-ido-prompt
                                   yas-completing-prompt))

  Also check out the customization group

       M-x customize-group RET yasnippet RET

  If you use the customization group to set variables
  `yas-snippet-dirs' or `yas-global-mode', make sure the path to
  "yasnippet.el" is present in the `load-path' *before* the
  `custom-set-variables' is executed in your .emacs file.

* 0.14.0 (Dec 22, 2019)

** Changes

*** New 'yas-auto-next' macro, automatically moves to next field.
See Github #937.

*** Yasnippet now officially requires Emacs 23 or greater.
See Github #940.

*** Snippets for 'fundamental-mode' are available in all modes.
See Github #949, and #936.

*** New function for snippets, 'yas-completing-read'.
See Github #934.

*** New function 'yas-maybe-expand-abbrev-key-filter'.
This can be used for making conditional keybindings for snippets.
Promoted from 'yas--maybe-expand-key-filter'.  See Github #943.

*** DEL can now be used to clear fields, similar &lt;delete>.
It is bound to the new conditional command 'yas-maybe-clear-field', which may
be bound to other keys as well.  See Github #960 and #957.

*** Snippet field movement commands may now trigger eldoc.
See Github #952.

*** New variable 'yas-keymap-disable-hook'.
Can be used (e.g., for company-mode) to temporarily disable
'yas-keymap' bindings, or any binding made by the new function
'yas-filtered-definition'.  See Github #987.

*** New variable 'yas-inhibit-overlay-modification-protection'.
This allows a snippet to remain active, even if some commands make
modifications outside the expected area (i.e., the active snippet
field).

*** 'yas-minor-mode' is no longer enabled in temp buffers.
That is, buffers whose name starts with a space.  This setting may be
undone by removing 'yas-temp-buffer-p' from
'yas-dont-activate-functions'.  See Github #985.

*** Accept unescaped '{', for LSP compatibility.
See Github #979.

** Fixed bugs

*** 'yas-not-string-or-comment-condition' no longer relies on 'this-command'.
This lets it work correctly with conditional key-bindings.  See Github
#973, #991.

*** Fix snippet expansion in org src buffers.
Note that this still doesn't work in text-mode blocks.
See Github #976, #989.

*** Fix snippet insertion for keyless snippets.
See Github #1014.

*** Fix errors with company-mode completion within snippet fields.
See Github #995.

*** Fix errors with cc-mode.
See Github #962.

*** Fix problems with lsp-mode.
**** Improve performance in overlay heavy buffers (Github #926).
**** Fix double call of 'before/after-change-functions' (Github #966).

*** Fix errors with nested snippet expansion.
See Github #961, #1002.

*** Stop yas-field-highlight-face inheriting from bogus 'quote' face.


* 0.13.0 (May 13, 2018)

** Changes

*** Snippets for Yasnippet must now be installed separately.  The
submodule linking to yasnippet-snippets was removed, as were the
"classic" snippets that came with the GNU ELPA package.  The latter
can now be installed via the 'yasnippet-classic-snippets' package from
GNU ELPA.
See Github #848, #858, #834, #775.

*** 'snippet-mode' no longer derives from 'text-mode'.
It will derive from 'prog-mode' where available (Emacs 24.1 and newer)
or 'fundamental-mode' otherwise.  See Github #826.

*** The default value of 'yas-key-syntaxes' is changed
Longer snippet abbrev keys are now preferred over shorter ones.
See Github #805.

*** New snippets are now created for the current major mode by default
Previously, extra activated modes could be guessed first.
See Github #875.

*** Yasnippet supports 'unload-feature' via 'yasnippet-unload-function'
See Github #753, #891.

*** New command 'yas-skip-and-clear-field' conditionally bound to 'C-d'
replaces obsoleted 'yas-skip-and-clear-or-delete-char'.  The new
function may be bound to any key via the conditional binding value
'yas-maybe-skip-and-clear-field', instead of hardcoding the
'delete-char' fallback action.  See Github #408, #892.

*** 'yas-lookup-snippet' now returns a struct
This allows 'yas-expand-snippet' to take looked up snippet's
environment into account.  'yas-expand-snippet' handles both
structured snippets, and plain text snippet bodies.
See Github #897.

** Fixed bugs

*** Avoid crash...
